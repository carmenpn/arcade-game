# Arcade Game - Avoid the ladybugs

## Characters

This game contains three types of characters:

1. The player
2. The ladybugs
3. The star

You are the player, who must defeat the ladybugs which are your enemies. And the star is your prize which you need to collect in order to win.

## How to run the game

Find the index.html document and open it into your default browser.
You will get the instructions on how to play the game in a pop-up window, but you can also find these instructions below.

## How to play

Your main goal in this game is to avoid the insects and collect 10 stars. For every star collected, you receive 10 points. If you reach 100 points, you win. 
But be careful, you cannot escape into the water and run away!

Use the arrows on your keyboard to move around your player. Remember that you cannot move off the canvas and those ladybugs will just keep on coming. 

Pay attention to the insects and stay away from them. If they touch you, your number of lives will decrease until you have none. And then, you lose the game. A pop-up window will appear to emphasize that.

But if you manage to avoid them and collect all the stars, then you win. Another pop-up window will appear, but a more cheerful one.

Have fun!
